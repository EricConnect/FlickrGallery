This is a application for interview.
In the beginning I want use MVP in whole project, but when I create it and finish code, I think that is boring add too much code just
for MVP.

It spent me about 8 hours to finish, mose difficulty is change dataset and recyclerView change to blank and endless scroll. 

Using RecyclerView, CardView, Glide,  Retrofit, rxJava, Kotlin 


Kotlin really shrink codes, very good and convenience.
